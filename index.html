            <p>For me, it's a responsibility to represent my family every time I step foot in the ring. When I came into
                this
                WWE business, there was a bar set for me. My goal is to push it as high as I can to make my family's
                legacy
                even
                stronger. To add to the history that's already been created. So for me, it's a huge challenge that I'm
                willing
                to fight for every single day.</p>
