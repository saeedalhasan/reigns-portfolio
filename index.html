            <p>For me, it's a responsibility to represent my family every time I step foot in the ring. When I came into
                this
                WWE business, there was a bar set for me. My goal is to push it as high as I can to make my family's
                legacy
                even
                stronger. To add to the history that's already been created. So for me, it's a huge challenge that I'm
                willing
                to fight for every single day.</p>

            <p>I was born, to handle situations the way I do. I've always been the type who can be thrown in the fire
                and make it out. Any time I'm given an opportunity, I feel I'm ready. Everyone has an opinion. That's
                just a crazy part of this world now. You can type things on the internet. You can have no credentials in
                any area and just get on your smart phone and write whatever you want. I know where I come from and
                where I want to go. I know I'm 100% ready. Everyone else seems to have an opinion, and claim to know,
                whether I am or I'm not. I would love to see all the people who run their mouths try and do what I do.
                Because they can't.</p>

                <p>At the end of the day, all I can be is me. I’m not John Cena. In my 30 years, I’ve never been John
                    Cena.
                    I don’t even think about becoming him. I just want to be – I want to be Roman Reigns. I want to do
                    things my way. I think that’s why I’m in the deep water with Vince McMahon and The Authority.</p>

                <p>I’m wrestling almost every single day of the week. I’m fighting for so much more. I’m trying to
                    capture a
                    life here, a future. I’m trying to put my kid in college. There are so many things I’m doing. I’m
                    representing the biggest wrestling family on earth.</p>
